as of

Maps, having only 2 dimensions to match the screen limitations. 
They will stored in vertical chunks (much like the original work it 
is based off of) that reach from the bottom of the world to the top. 
Sticking to the original content, the number of blocks in one 
vertical stack will be 128. The number of vertical stacks allotted 
in a chunk is still undecided but will probably range between 8 an 12.

While the world's horizontal size will be initially limited in size 
(although to what degree is currently undecided), world generation 
will be included after an acceptable version is committed.
