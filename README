The purpose of this project is to make a browser-based game, visually 
styled as a gameboy game. HTML, CSS, and Javascript will be used.

Naturally the game will be free, as is the source code and any other 
in-game content committed to the repo.

Tools/programs used:
    +github
    +Aptana Studio 3
